        <h1>Lab 4 Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
        <p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>It was easy creating the file structure once I got the hang of it, but I had soem difficulty creating index.html files and making them work right.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Well you are looking at the index.html file I created. Here is the file structure that I made:</p>
        <img src="img/java.png" width=650>
				<h3> The Game </h3>
				<script src="js/lab.js"></script>
        <div class="linkbox">
            <a class="homelink" href="../index.html">&lt;&lt; Back home</a>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
