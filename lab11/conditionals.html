            <h1>Lab 11: Conditionals</h1>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Working with your partner, create a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p> Working with our partner, to create a function that depends on conditionals.For us we really like working with these exercises. We learn as we go, though sometimes we get lost but we go back to the other labs as a reference. We were tasked with creating a new javascript and experimenting with it.The Javascript <i>and</i>the code that we ended up using are the ones that we were building on previous things that we've learned and experimented with new things and aren't too challenging for beginning programmers to complete. We were challenged but overall we were successful with it. We liked this exercise because the Sorting Hat function was fun and interesting for the both of us who love Harry Potter!!</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>I created a pretty straight forward conditional in my function, but realized after writing it, the repetitive structure probably means there is a more efficient way to write this. Probably using an object as key-value pairs will be simple, work really well, and be easy to maintain.</p>
