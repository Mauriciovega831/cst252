            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The sorted name was some what easy because I already had an idea on  how to do it but after getting my hands on the coding part of this assigments. Converting to an array seems a bit like tricky but after taking it a shot at this. Shuffling the name was more of a challenge. I'd never done that before (that I remember). I definitely fooled around a good bit to get the CSS to place the name over my image. It helped to turn borders on for that elements so I could position it properly. There are still long names that break the formatting, but it's okay for now -- a balance of simple coding and interesting results.</p>
